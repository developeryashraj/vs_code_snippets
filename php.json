	// Place your snippets for PHP here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	//copy  array variable, run this snippet, do paste.
	"print array": {
		"prefix": "pre",
		"body": [
			"echo '<pre>';print_r($1);echo '</pre>';exit;"
		],
		"description": "print array in better format"
	},
	//copy  array variable, run this snippet, do paste.
	"echo variable": {
		"prefix": "echo",
		"body": [
			"echo $1;exit;"
		],
		"description": "echo variable with exit"
	},
	//run snippet, start typing something if wanted to differentiate echo text. (no need to worry about cursor placement)
	"break point": {
		"prefix": "abc_php",
		"body": [
			"echo 'abc$1';exit;"
		],
		"description": "echo abc with exit"

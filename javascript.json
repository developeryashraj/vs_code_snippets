	// Place your snippets for JavaScript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	//copy variable, run this snippet, do paste.
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": [
			"console.log($1);"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	},
	//copy object, run this snippet, do paste.
	"Print object to console": {
		"prefix": "log_obj",
		"body": [
			"console.log('Object data :- %o',$1);"
		],
		"description": "Log object output to console"

	//run snippet, start typing something if wanted to differentiate log text. (no need to worry about cursor placement)
